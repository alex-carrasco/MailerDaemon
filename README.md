## The MailerDaemon Suite

The suite currently contains a Domain Name System-based Blackhole List (DNSBL) solution and an Open-Tracking solution.

### DNSBL Checker

The DNSBL Checker allows you to configure a set IPs to check against known blacklists. The either IP or Blacklist list can be easily expanded by modifying their .json files.

### MailTrack

MailTrack is a simple pixel tracking application which can be modified or extended with ease. Once hosted on a production server, the handler will retrieve browser information and record the details to a DB.
